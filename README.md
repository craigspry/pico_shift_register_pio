# Raspberry Pi Pico 74HC595 PIO Example
Here is an example of how to write to a 74HC595 in both C and Micro Python. To build the C project follow the instrutions here [Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf). The Micro Pyhton version should juxt be a drag and drop in Thonny. The C version counts and the Micro Python version displays the current temperature reading of the onboard temperature sensor.  

## Breadboard wiring diagram
Below is a picture of how the breadboard was wired up, I am a complete novice at electronics so there is most likely a mistake so please check with a datasheet first to confirm what pin goes where.
